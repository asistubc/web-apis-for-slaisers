# Web APIs for SLAISers who can't request good and wanna learn to do other stuff good too
Resources on Web APIs for SLAIS Code Club (March 7, 2017)

## What's a web service API?
>“Extending a metaphor used by David Orenstein, let’s imagine that you are building a deck in your backyard and you realize that you don’t have a hammer. You have three neighbors who you know have a hammer. One neighbor never allows anyone to borrow anything or use any of his stuff without paying up. This neighbor represents a closed or proprietary system. Another neighbor leaves his garage open and allows you to take anything you need without any rules or guidelines. This is your bearded open-source neighbor. **The third neighbor represents an API. You can utilize the services of her hammer as long as you ask her in the proper way. Furthermore, she doesn’t actually give it to you; she just allows you to use it.**” [Michel, 2013, xi][1]

Yeah, pretty much.
